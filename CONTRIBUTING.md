## Contributing

We love to get pull requests, here's how we like to work:

- Open a pull request. Before you start coding, let's make sure we're on the same page.
- Fork the repo.
- Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests: `bundle && rake`
- Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests.
- Make the test pass, following the conventions you see used in the source already.
- If you have made a number of commits, squash them before pushing.
- Push to your fork and update your pull request.
- We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
